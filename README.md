# Web Programming Project
There were 3 parts to creating this website:

1. Create the html, css, and add form validation with `JavaScript`
2. Add form validation using `PHP`
3. Persist the form data to a database, then retrieve that data to display a confirmation page

The instructions that were given can be found in `Project1.pdf`, `Project2.pdf`, and `Project3.pdf` respectively.

## TODO
I already had significant web development experience so I took this project as an opportunity to have some fun with `SVG` and animations. I'd like to eventually strip out the `PHP` so people can view the site with a plain web browser.

Also the code is a mess and inline svg looks horrible. I need to go in and clean it up.
